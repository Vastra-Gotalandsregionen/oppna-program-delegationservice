Delegation need to be handled with care.

The person delegation his/her work has to:
  * validate his/her identity by digital signing the delegation.
  * specify what type of work should be delegated.
  * specify who (other user or group of users) is authorized to do the work.

The delegation service will also facilitate revisions/audits of active delegations. Partikular care has to be taken when the person delegating tasks change work responsibilities or leave his/her position.
